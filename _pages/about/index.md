I'm in my final year of [medical school](http://mdprogram.med.ubc.ca/2016/10/11/md-student-daniel-raff-receives-the-2016-canadian-medical-hall-of-fame-award/) and in the process of completing a [Master's of Data Science](https://masterdatascience.science.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia. 
 

<br>


I've gone on some adventures:

* The [Mongol Rally](https://danielraff.com/travel/Mongol-Rally.html) - a charity drive from London, England to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia  
* Worked on water infrastructure and health education for a remote school in the Indian Himalayan region ([Spiti Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiti_Valley))  

<br>

I've made some things:

* Co-Founder and board member of [Hatching Health](http://www.hatchinghealth.com/)
* A recommender system for [Read by QxMD](https://qxmd.com/read-by-qxmd) (an app for viewing medical research papers)
* [Visualization of Canadian Medical Health Survey Data](https://raffrica.shinyapps.io/cad_mental_health_viz/)

I like to [swim](http://vancouver.ca/parks-recreation-culture/kitsilano-pool.aspx), [snowboard](https://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/), run, and bike in Vancouver, British Columbia.

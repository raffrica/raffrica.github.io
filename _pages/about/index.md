I'm in my final year of medical school at University of British Columbia (UBC).  

I'm completing a [Master's of Data Science](https://masterdatascience.science.ubc.ca/).  

I've gone on some adventures:

* The [Mongol Rally](http://www.theadventurists.com/mongol-rally-where-and-when/) - a charity drive from London, England to Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia  
* Worked on water infrastructure and health education for a remote school in the Indian Himalayan region ([Spiti Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiti_Valley))  



I've made some things:

* Co-Founded and on the board for [Hatching Health](http://www.hatchinghealth.com/)
* [Visualization of Canadian Medical Health Survey Data](https://raffrica.shinyapps.io/cad_mental_health_viz/)


I like to [swim](http://vancouver.ca/parks-recreation-culture/kitsilano-pool.aspx), [snowboard](https://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/), run, and bike in Vancouver, British Columbia.

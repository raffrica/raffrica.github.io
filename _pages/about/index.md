I am a family doctor working in the Metro Vancouver area with a clinical focus in addictions, hospital medicine, and community based family practice. I completed a [Master's of Data Science](https://masterdatascience.science.ubc.ca/) and my family medicine training at the [University of British Columbia](http://mdprogram.med.ubc.ca/2016/10/11/md-student-daniel-raff-receives-the-2016-canadian-medical-hall-of-fame-award/).
